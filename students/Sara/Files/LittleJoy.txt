Mama someday you'll be so proud of me
You'll see me hanging in a New York gallery
Someday I'm gonna draw from the left side of my brain
People are gonna ask, "is it brilliant or plain?"

But as long as I don't know
How to hang a Warhol
I'll keep sketching birds
That are all like her
Very simple and true
Like you've known me to do
And if you like 'em
Yeah but if you don't it's not bad
Cause I really don't care
