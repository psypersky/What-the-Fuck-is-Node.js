#### Fucking Modules



* Each file is its own module.
* Each file has access to the current module definition using the module variable.
* The export of the current module is determined by the module.exports variable.
* To import a module, use the globally available require function.


- require is synchronous
- modules are cached, require.cache used for testing mostly
